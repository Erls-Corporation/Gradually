How to use
----------

It often include code snippets, which are just indented pieces of text:

	#JS
	var script = new MyScript()
	script.doSomething();

If the first line is #JS or #CSS or #HTML, then the code is highlighted accordingly. 

Screenshots
-----------

This section is optional, but encouraged if the plugin affords it. Just a list of images, one per line. We do the resizing, so use actual size screenshots.
